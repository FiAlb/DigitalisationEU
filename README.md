# DigitalisationEU

## Overview

This project investigates the distribution of digital skills across Europe, exploring key factors that influence higher levels of digital skills. The analysis focuses on age, gender equality, income inequality, and internet infrastructure to understand which countries are leading in digital skills and why. This work aligns with the European Commission's Digital Decade Initiative, which aims for at least 80% of citizens aged 16-74 to possess basic digital skills by 2030.

## Research Objectives

### Understand the Relationship Between Age and Digital Skills
Identify which age groups have the highest digital skills levels and assess how this varies by region.
### Examine Gender Equality
Investigate whether countries with higher gender equality indices show more advanced digital skills among women.
### Analyze the Impact of Income Inequality
Determine if economic equality within a country correlates with the level of digital skills.
### Assess the Role of Internet Infrastructure
Evaluate whether better internet quality contributes to higher digital skill.
